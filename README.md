				# my_custom_database

 Using python and Flask, I have created a custom database that uses CRUD to modify different sets of data stored in our database. I has an interactive REPL that uses SQL syntax to manipulate data in my database.I will have a front-end for showing my tables  in a web-app that is why I use flask as a framework.

Some of the imports that I have used are:
 - Flask -  to be able to use flask web framework
 - re - (regular expression) will act as my parser, this will be used to identify keywords
 - json - for storing my data
 - cmd - this is what I use to create my REPL
